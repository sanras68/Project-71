        <p class="text-muted">In 1538 Richard and Elizabeth Codington sold the manor of Cuddington to Henry VIII, who
          started building Nonsuch Palace. Henry VIII wiped away the old village of Cuddington including the old
          manor/mansion house and the church when he started work on Nonsuch Palace and created two parks – The Great
          Park and The Little Park. The Great Park was to the west of modern day London Road and covered about 911 acres
          – much of what is today Stoneleigh and Worcester Park. The Little Park was about 671 acres and was to the east
          of modern day London Road, covering what is today the land between Ewell and Cheam (including of course,
          modern day Nonsuch Park). The total area of the palace grounds was not just limited to the manor of Cuddington
          as Henry acquired about 150 acres each from the Manors of Ewell and from Malden.

        <p class="text-muted">The Library is situated on the first floor of the new building of the school. It is a
          welcoming and spacious environment with ample shelving, seating areas for comfort and for study, an IT area, a

          resources and information that supports learning across the curriculum.

          There are over 15,000 resources, incorporating fiction, non-fiction, online resources and periodicals together
          with a growing selection of e-books. The library also subscribes to The Day which is a current affairs and

        <h5 class="text-success text-capitalize">Was estabilished in 1909</h5>
        <p class="text-muted">The Excelsior Scottish Rite Temple, also known as the Samuel French House, White Mansion,
          Dungarven, and Hurley Mansion, has a fascinating history. Earlier inhabitants of the Mansion include Samuel
          French (of Smith Kline and French Co.) and Edward Collings Knight, Sr., inventor of the Pullman sleeping car
          for railroads. Mr. Knight was a descendant of the Collings family for whom the borough and Knight Park are
          named. Dr. William Albert Davis, of Cooper Hospital in Camden and a 32nd Degree Mason, operated a maternity
          hospital in the White Mansion. In 1909, William Hurley, owner of a successful chain of furniture stores,
          purchased the estate and named it in honor of his birthplace, Dungarven, in County Waterford, Ireland.

          The property was purchased by the Excelsior Scottish Rite in 1930 for $125,000 from the estate of William
          Hurley. In 2003, the Borough of Collingswood entered a 50-year lease of the building owned by the Scottish
          Rite Freemasons. The Borough appointed the management of the venue to the Collingswood Foundation for the
          Arts, a registered 501(c)3. Since 2003, many repairs, renovations, and improvements have been made to the
          mansion, auditorium, and ballroom, all the while preserving its historic charm. During the past 19 years, more
          than a million guests have visited this classic venue</p>

        <p>Tackling the climate crisis requires all countries to make bold pledges under the Paris Agreement, or NDCs,
          to reduce emissions of the greenhouse gases that cause global warming and strengthen adaptation to its
          impacts. The Climate Promise is our commitment to ensure that any country wishing to increase the ambition of
          their national climate pledge is able to do so.

          UNDP is now scaling up its support for countries to turn their NDC targets into concrete action while

        <p>A science fair is an opportunity for students to do an independent science project following either the
          scientific method or the engineering design process. Students conduct their research then present their
          results at a science fair. Science fairs occur at different levels including classroom, school-wide, regional,
          state, and international. Typically students present their science projects to other students, teachers, and
          sometimes families at the lower levels. At higher level science fairs, students also present their projects to
          judges and prizes are awarded for the best science projects. Our directory of science fairs can help you find
          regional, state, and international science competitions in your area.

          If you are interested in competing at advanced science competitions, our Advanced Project Guide, includes tips
          for success, how to get started in advanced research, finding a mentor, and much more.</p>

      <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">As part of the school
        environment, a canteen is in a unique position to make a positive contribution to students health and welfare.
        The functions of school canteens are to:

        provide a service to the school community
        provide a variety of nutritious and attractively presented food and drinks at a reasonable cost and reinforce
        classroom learning
        The canteen provides a rewarding opportunity for parents to be involved in their childs school. A canteen can
        become an essential source of nutrition education that supports what students learn in the classroom and
        supports a whole school approach to healthy eating such as; the school produce garden.</p>

      <h1>Implemented Online Attendance Management System</h1>
      <img src="attendance.jpg" class="img-responsive col-lg-5 col-md-5 col-sm-5 col-xs-12">
      <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">The primary rationale for high-quality
        attendance data is the relationship between student attendance and student achievement. Teacher effectiveness is
        the strongest school-related determinant of student success,1 but chronic student absence reduces even the best
        teacher's ability to provide learning opportunities. Students who attend school regularly have been shown to
        achieve at higher levels than students who do not have regular attendance. This relationship between attendance
        and achievement may appear early in a child's school career. A recent study looking at young children found that
        absenteeism in kindergarten was associated with negative first grade outcomes such as greater absenteeism in
        subsequent years and lower achievement in reading, math, and general knowledge.2

        RESEARCH SHOWS THAT ATTENDANCE IS AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT.

        Poor attendance has serious implications for later outcomes as well. High school dropouts have been found to
        exhibit a history of negative behaviors, including high levels of absenteeism throughout their childhood, at
        higher rates than high school graduates.3 These differences in absentee rates were observed as early as
        kindergarten, and students who eventually dropped out of high school missed significantly more days of school in
        first grade than their peers who graduated from high school. In eighth grade, this pattern was even more
        apparent and, by ninth grade, attendance was shown to be a key indicator significantly correlated with high
        school graduation.
